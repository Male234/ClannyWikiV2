# Setup Clanny

Welcome to Clanny! This guide will tell you how to configure Clanny

## The first part: `/setup`

In order to be able to use Clanny you have to run `/setup` first.

This the syntax is: `/setup [Group ID]`

If your group link is https://www.roblox.com/groups/7370273/Clanny-Systems#!/about your group ID would be `7370273`

### Possible issues

If the bot says you need to be verified, run `/verify` **WITH CLANNY** and try again.

If the bot says you need to own the Roblox group, you used your group link instead of group ID, or you dont own that group

If the bot says you need to own the Discord server, run it in your own Discord server or get the Discord server owner to run it if you are helping him setting it up

## The second part, your ranks

Configuring your ranks is very easy using the [Dashboard](https://clanny-gateway.glitch.me)

:::info
The dashboard requires a Clanny managed account to be in your group, request it [here](https://www.discord.gg/wCxW92bvp7)

## The third part

Have fun!
